    <h2 id="cargo-is-cool-but">Cargo is Cool, But…</h2>

<p>Cargo is an important feature of the Rust ecosystem, providing a central
repository of versioned packages and ensuring <em>reproducible builds</em>.
It has learned important lessons from more ad-hoc solutions like Go’s
‘go get’. It is widely considered one of the great strengths of Rust.</p>

<p>So suggesting that it is not ideal for all situations may come across
as being difficult.</p>

<p>The recommended go-to tool for testing out snippets is the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">Rust Playground</a>,
(which is in fact how I got sucked into Rust in the first place). It is
particularly good for showing other people your illustrative little programs.
But I have decent hardware and like using my editor of choice, so I prefer
to run trivial programs locally.</p>

<p>When writing Rust programs, no matter how trivial, the advice to
beginners is to create a Cargo project:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cargo new myprog
$ cd myprog
$ edit src/main.rs
$ cargo run
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You do get a lot for free once something is a Cargo project - <code class="highlighter-rouge">cargo run</code>
will rebuild if needed, if the source changes or the compiler changes.
(This is useful in a language where a new stable version comes out
every six weeks.)  The Rust standard library is deliberately kept
compact and much functionality is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">crates.io</code>
repository. If you have a cargo project, then adding a crate reference
after “[dependencies]” in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cargo.toml</code> will cause that dependency to
be downloaded and built for your project.  By default, it creates a Git repo.</p>

<p>There are some downsides. You will notice with non-trivial
dependencies (like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">regex</code> crate) that a lot of code is downloaded
and compiled. The source will be cached, but the compiled libraries
are not.  So the next dinky program you write that uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">regex</code> will
require those libraries to be recompiled.  This is pretty much the
only way you can get the desired state of reproducibility (the problem
is harder than you might think).</p>

<p>However, if you are willing to relax about reproducibility, those
“build artifacts” can be made once and thereafter reused to build
other programs.  Small exploratory programs need not be built with the
rigour necessary for large-scale systems.</p>

<h2 id="running-snippets">Running ‘Snippets’</h2>

<p><strong>runner</strong> is mostly a clever wrapper around normal Cargo operations.
To install, just say <code class="highlighter-rouge">cargo install runner</code>.</p>

<p>The word ‘snippet’ here means an abbreviated way to write Rust
programs. The original inspiration was the form of <em>documentation
tests</em>. Here is the example for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">len</code> method of the primitive
<code class="highlighter-rouge">str</code> type:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="nf">.len</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"ƒoo"</span><span class="nf">.len</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c">// fancy f!</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cargo test</code> will make such examples into proper little programs, and
run them as pass-fail tests.  It’s an elegant way to both test an API
and ensure that <em>all examples compile</em>.</p>

<p>If I save this as <code class="highlighter-rouge">len.rs</code>, then <strong>runner</strong> will compile and run it directly:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ runner len.rs
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>There’s no output, but if you don’t appreciate the difference between
bytes and characters and insist that the last line should be
<code class="highlighter-rouge">assert_eq!(3, len)</code> then the assertion will fail and the result will
show a runtime panic.</p>

<p>We can communicate with the world in the time-honoured way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat print.rs
println!("hello world");
$ runner print.rs
hello world
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This certainly involves less typing - <strong>runner</strong> is making up a <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code>
function for us. By default, it compiles the program <em>dynamically</em> -
i.e. not linking in the Rust stdlib statically. The result is not
portable and not something you can hand out to your friends, but it is
faster. On my work machine, the default dynamic compile  is 187ms
versus 374ms for <code class="highlighter-rouge">runner -s print.rs</code>.</p>

<p>Refugees from dynamic ‘scripting’ languages will find this
refreshingly familiar - <strong>runner</strong> acts like an <em>interpreter</em>.
There is no forced directory structure, just source.  But
it’s just using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rustc</code> under the hood in the most direct way
possible.  If it <em>was</em> a true interpreter, then I could provide you
with a read-eval-loop (REPL) as with Python. (This would be very cool, but
also very hard.)  I don’t personally miss having a REPL that much, since
running snippets is usually fast enough and you can write your code
in a proper editor.</p>

<p><strong>runner</strong> does more than wrap code in <code class="highlighter-rouge">fn main</code> - it puts the code in
a function returning a boxed error result. So the question-mark
operator works, and you can write real little programs without ugly
<code class="highlighter-rouge">unwrap</code> calls.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// file.rs</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">File</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"file.rs"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">?</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">buf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">String</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="n">f</span><span class="nf">.read_to_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span> <span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">?</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{}"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>How is <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> available? Because the generated program has a <em>prelude</em>
written at the top, which you can view (and edit) with <code class="highlighter-rouge">runner
--edit-prelude</code>.</p>

<p>(If you are curious, the expanded source will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.cargo/.runner/bin/file.rs</code>)</p>

<p>We can get even more concise with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-e</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">--expression</code> flag:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ runner -e '"¡Hola!".len()'
7
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On a Unix command-prompt, I need to quote the whole expression in
single quotes; for Windows (where quoting is mostly broken) you would
use double-quotes for the expression, and single quoted strings will
be massaged into double-quotes internally.</p>

<p>For the  <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">--iterator</code> flag, the expression is an iterator and
<strong>runner</strong> will make up a little program to print out all the values
of the iterator:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ runner -i "(0..4).map(|n| 2*n)"
0
2
4
6
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="keeping-a-cache">Keeping a Cache</h2>

<p><strong>runner</strong> can link in external crates. What it does is keep a <em>static
cache</em> of crates managed by Cargo.</p>

<p>Say you are curious about the old-fashioned but useful crate <a href="https://docs.rs/time">time</a>.
You can add <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> to the cache with <code class="highlighter-rouge">runner --add time</code> - it will do
the usual Cargo dance.</p>

<p>Write a little snippet like so, anywhere you like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// time.rs</span>
<span class="k">extern</span> <span class="n">crate</span> <span class="n">time</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"{:?}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nn">time</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">now</span><span class="p">());</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and compile-and-go like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ runner -s time.rs
Tm { tm_sec: 16, tm_min: 39, tm_hour: 10, tm_mday: 15, tm_mon: 11,
tm_year: 117, tm_wday: 5, tm_yday: 348, tm_isdst: 0,
tm_utcoff: 7200, tm_nsec: 917431093 }
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-s</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">--static</code>) flag is important, since the crates in the
cache will be linked in statically to make a program, not the usual
dynamic default.</p>

<p>The documentation for <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> is also built locally, and you can open
it in your browser with <code class="highlighter-rouge">runner --doc time</code>.</p>

<p>Even less typing - this is almost exactly the same program (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-x</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">--extern</code> for
bringing in an external crate.)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ runner -s -xtime -e 'time::now()'
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is certainly more convenient.
But the big time-saving comes from the cache saving built libraries,
both for debug and for release.</p>

<p>You can now write multiple little programs referencing <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> and not have to
rebuild <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> each time as with Cargo projects.</p>

<p>(<strong>runner</strong> will accept proper programs if it detects <code class="highlighter-rouge">fn main</code>, but
you may have to give it hints with <code class="highlighter-rouge">--extern</code> to resolve crates.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, after filling your cache with interesting and useful
crates, you can take your laptop on the subway or on your favourite
connection-challenged getaway, and still play with your programs. The
built crates are in the cache, and so is the documentation - no
<em>constant</em> need for internet.  Consider also that many people out
there simply don’t have the consistent always-on internet connection
that modern tools now <em>take for granted</em>. This is not necessarily such
a Third World problem either, considering that corporate firewalls and
policies are also hostile to such tools.</p>

<p>Rust is otherwise well suited for off-line work, since you get the stdlib
documentation (and several books!) installed for local browsing. <strong>runner</strong>
furthermore makes the documentation of all cached crates available through
<code class="highlighter-rouge">runner --doc</code>, complementing <code class="highlighter-rouge">rustup doc --std</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>runner</strong> makes experimenting with Rust easier.  I use it to
prototype bits of code, even the nucleus of new projects, which then
become proper Cargo projects. This particularly matters when dealing with larger projects
where a build can take many seconds or even minutes. Debugging the logic
of a tricky dozen lines can then get seriously slow.</p>

<p>It can compile crates dynanically (that is, as DLL or .so files) but
this is still experimental, and is essentially just an optimization at
the moment - see <a href="https::/docs.rs/runner">the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>But the main idea is to reduce the amount of boilerplate
and bureaucracy needed to test out small bits of example code.  I
would certainly have found this very useful when learning Rust, and
I hope <strong>runner</strong> will be useful to others as well, whether beginners or
seasoned pros.</p>
